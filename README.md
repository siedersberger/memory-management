# memory-management (maping)

A simple way to maping memory is using linked lists.
In this project, three distincts algorithms are used to alloc elements (process) in the memory, such as:

- First Fit;
- Best Fit;
- Worst Fit;
 
The main objective is compare these algorithms in terms of allocation percentage and number of segmentations.
